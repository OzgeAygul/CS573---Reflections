Analytics and visualizations are great, but it is even better if it is available to the masses.
Approximately seven months ago, I came across a sankey diagram that shows vote shifts in presidential elections in Turkey.

For the general public, this visualization simplifies complex data (without oversimplifying), making it easier to understand the volume of votes transferred.
The diagram clearly shows how votes for parties in the general elections in 2018 have translated into votes for individual presidential candidates.
The flows can indicate, for example, whether voters remained loyal to the party's presidential candidate, or there was a shift, with voters from one party in the general elections choosing a different candidate.
It also provides numerical data on votes for each party or candidate at the starting and ending points, which can be helpful in understanding the scale of each flow.
