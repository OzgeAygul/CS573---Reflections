This visualization, made by NYtimes shows what is left of one of the oldest streets in Hatay, after the massive earthquake a year ago.
With the storytelling technique, we can see drone footage after the earthquake along with the pictures of what the buildings looked like before, by overlaying images of buildings from Google Maps' street view.
As we go through the street, personal stories pop up about the street's landmarks and people who used to live there.

I find this type of visual essay because of many reasons.
First, it helps readers understand the event's scope and gives a sense of the people living there.
Second, it reminds us that people who have passed away are more than mere statistics; they were individuals with lives as rich and complex as our own. 
They had families, daily routines, and dreamsâ€”just like us. And, they all went to bed at night before with plans for tomorrow, without knowing it was their last sleep.
To summarize, this news could only consist of statistics, stories and photos of rubbles. 
Instead, they created this visual essay to make a difference.
