This visualization, made by NYtimes shows what is left of one of the oldest streets in Hatay, after the massive earthquake took place a year ago.
With storytelling technique, we are able to see drone footage after the earthquake along with the pictures of what the buildings looked like before, by overlaying images of buildings from Google Maps' street view.
As we go through the street, personal stories pops up about the landmarks of the street.
